WEB INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGN

TASK 2 DEFINITION

üåê Designing a Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com:
Let's outline a three-server web infrastructure to host www.foobar.com that prioritizes security, encrypted traffic, and robust monitoring.

üîí Security Measures:
‚Ä¢	Firewalls: We incorporate three firewalls to provide multiple layers of security. Firewalls act as barriers, filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic, safeguarding the infrastructure from unauthorized access.

‚Ä¢	SSL Certificate: We implement an SSL certificate to enable HTTPS for www.foobar.com. This ensures encrypted communication between users' browsers and the server, enhancing data security and privacy.

üìä Monitoring Implementation:

‚Ä¢	Monitoring Clients: We deploy three monitoring clients that act as data collectors, gathering information about the infrastructure's performance and health. These clients transmit data to monitoring services like Sumo Logic.

Why Each Element?

‚Ä¢	Firewalls: Multiple firewalls bolster security, preventing unauthorized access, intrusion attempts, and malicious activities.

‚Ä¢	SSL Certificate: Enabling HTTPS ensures that data transmitted between users and the server is encrypted, protecting sensitive information from eavesdropping and tampering.

‚Ä¢	Monitoring Clients: Monitoring tools continuously collect and analyze data from various components, helping to identify performance issues, anomalies, and potential threats.

‚Ä¢	Monitoring Data Collection:

The monitoring tool collects data by integrating monitoring agents (clients) into each server. These agents gather information such as server health, resource utilization, and application performance.

Monitoring Web Server QPS:

To monitor the web server's Query Per Second (QPS):

‚Ä¢	Utilize the monitoring tool's dashboard to monitor the web server's performance metrics.
‚Ä¢	Set up alerts to notify administrators if QPS exceeds or falls below acceptable thresholds.
‚Ä¢	Use aggregated data to optimize the web server's configuration and capacity.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

‚Ä¢	Terminating SSL at Load Balancer Level: While terminating SSL at the load balancer enhances efficiency, it means the internal network traffic might be unencrypted. End-to-end encryption is compromised.

‚Ä¢	Single MySQL Server Accepting Writes: Depending on a single MySQL server for write operations poses a risk. If it fails, write functionality is lost, impacting data integrity.

‚Ä¢	Homogeneous Server Components: Servers with identical components could lead to a single point of failure. If a critical component fails, all servers might be affected.
